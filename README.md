# Diary

---

> Diary based on Vue.js Vite

## Setup

```bash
## Install dependencies
yarn

## Serve on localhost:1234
yarn dev

## Build for production
yarn build
```

##### After build I highly recommend to change in dist folder paths to './' from '/'.

###### I was trying to find way to change, but vue.config.js seems to doesn't work for Vite for now.
